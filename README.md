This project involves training and evaluating machine learning models (Decision Tree and Random Forest) to classify Windows PE files as either malicious or legitimate.

Key steps performed:

Extracted structural features from a set of benign and malicious PE files into a CSV dataset.

Trained both classifier models on the custom dataset.

Calculated the accuracy of each model.

Generated a graphical visualization of the resulting Decision Tree.
